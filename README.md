Note: This is my second homework assignment for the Data Mining course. I initially completed the work in PyCharm but migrated it to a Jupyter Notebook for ease of reading. The problem solutions are provided in a separate PDF document.

In the code, I experimented with three data-loading approaches: local file loading, URL-based loading, and Python library-based loading. However, to avoid redundancy, I have uploaded only the locally loaded dataset (the iris.data file) to this repository.

This note aims to clarify the structure and ensure smooth navigation of the submitted materials. Thank you!
